# EigenDA Plasma DA Server

## Introduction

This simple DA server implementation supports ephemeral storage via EigenDA. 

## EigenDA Configuration
Additional cli args are provided for targeting an EigenDA network backend:
- `--eigenda-rpc`: RPC host of disperser service. (e.g, on holesky this is `disperser-holesky.eigenda.xyz:443`)
- `--eigenda-status-query-timeout`: (default: 1m) Duration for which a client will wait for a blob to finalize after being sent for dispersal.
- `--eigenda-status-query-retry-interval`: (default: 5s) How often a client will attempt a retry when awaiting network blob finalization. 
- `--eigenda-use-tls`: (default: true) Whether or not to use TLS for grpc communication with disperser.

## Breaking Changes

### Server / Client
Unlike the keccak256 DA server implementation where commitments can be generated by the batcher, commitments with EigenDA are only derivable **once** a blob has been successfully finalized (i.e, dispersed, confirmed, and submitted within a batch to Ethereum). The existing `op-plasma` schema of having a precomputed key was broken in the following ways:
* POST `/put` endpoint was modified to remove the `commitment` query param and return the generated `commitment` value in the response body
* Introduced a `ForkedDaClient` which uses alternative request/response flows with server for inserting and fetching preimages

### Commitment Schemas
An `EigenDACommitment` type has been added that supports verification against its respective preimages. Otherwise this logic is pseudo-identical to the existing `Keccak256` commitment type.
